# WebRic IRC

WebRic provides an easy to use HTML5 IRC client

WebRic uses a WebSockets backend written in ruby / [EventMachine](https://github.com/eventmachine/eventmachine) + [em-websockets](https://github.com/igrigorik/em-websocket).

The frontend is written in javascript using [BootStrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [JQuery](jquery.com).

WebRic is still in very early development and is not quite ready for production use, but feel free to play with it, fork it, and contribute to it!
